__Task 1 : Currency Converter in java__

__Description :__ 

A currency converter is a program that takes an amount in one currency and converts it to another currency based on the current exchange rate. The user enters the amount to be converted and selects the currencies to convert between. The program then retrieves the current exchange rate for the selected currencies and performs the conversion.

Once you have retrieved the exchange rate, you can use it to convert the amount from one currency to another. You will need to take into account the exchange rate and any fees or charges that may be incurred during the conversion process.

Overall, a currency converter in Java involves retrieving exchange rates from an API and using them to convert amounts between different currencies. It requires knowledge of Java programming, APIs, and currency exchange rates.

__Task 2 : Tic Tac Toe game in Java__

__Description :__ 

A tic tac toe game in Java involves creating a 3x3 grid and allowing two players to take turns placing their respective marks (X or O) on the grid. The player who places three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

To implement a tic tac toe game in Java, you will need to create a user interface that displays the 3x3 grid and allows the players to interact with it. You can use a GUI framework like Swing or JavaFX to create the user interface.

The game logic involves checking the state of the grid after each player's turn to determine if any player has won the game or if the game is a draw. You can use an array or a 2D array to store the state of the grid and update it after each player's turn.

To determine if a player has won the game, you will need to check if there are three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. You can use nested loops to iterate over the rows, columns, and diagonals of the grid and check for matches.

If a player has won the game, the program should display a message indicating the winner and end the game. If the game is a draw, the program should display a message indicating the draw and end the game.

Overall, a tic tac toe game in Java involves creating a user interface, implementing the game logic, and handling user input. It requires knowledge of Java programming, GUI frameworks, and game development.

__Task 3 : Scientific Calculator in java__

__Description :__

A scientific calculator in Java is a program that provides advanced mathematical functions beyond basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These advanced functions may include trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, exponential functions, and others.

To implement a scientific calculator in Java, you will need to create a user interface that allows the user to input mathematical expressions and displays the results. You can use a GUI framework like Swing or JavaFX to create the user interface.

The program should be able to handle both simple and complex mathematical expressions. It should parse the input expression and evaluate it using the appropriate mathematical functions. You can use libraries like Jep, MathEclipse, or Apache Commons Math to handle the parsing and evaluation of mathematical expressions.

In addition to the basic arithmetic operations, the calculator should provide buttons or functions for advanced mathematical operations like square root, logarithm, exponentiation, trigonometric functions, and others. These functions can be implemented using the Java Math library, which provides a wide range of mathematical functions.

The user interface should also allow the user to perform operations like clearing the display, backspace, and memory functions like saving and recalling values.

Overall, a scientific calculator in Java involves creating a user interface, parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions, implementing advanced mathematical functions, and handling user input. It requires knowledge of Java programming, GUI frameworks, and advanced mathematical concepts.
